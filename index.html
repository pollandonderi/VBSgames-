            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Buckets of 10L each</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>2 carwash sponges</li>

                <li>For a tape measure, we will use a rope</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process 1 </h2>
            <p>
                Set a row of 2 buckets and fill each bucket with water (keep in mind, the more water you put in
                the bucket, the longer the game will take). Then set a row of 2 empty buckets on the opposite
                side of your area (distance between depends on the size of the groups). Each group gets a car
                wash sponge. Line up each group’s parcipants spaced in between the bucket with water and
                the empty bucket. The point of the game is for the child next to the water bucket to soak the
                sponge and carry it to the next child and so on unl the last child who carries it to the empty
                bucket to squeeze out. The group to empty their bucket the fastest while retaining the most
                water wins!

I give a new rule to you Love one another You must love each other as I have loved you In this
way everyone will know you are my disciples They know it if you really love each other
The have been scrambled as follows:
I egvi a wne uerl ot uyo eovl eon ertahon uyo smtu vole ehca hoert as I eavh dlvoe oyu ni sthi
yaw yoreeenv ilwl knwo yuo ear my lisdsecip ehyt oknw it fi uoy reyall ovle hcae horte
Divide the children into two groups.
Instrucons:
Write each of the scrambled words in cut plain papers and fold them into small equal pieces.
Put them in one n. Repeat the process once so that both ns have the same content.
Let each team choose one person who will be wring the messages and let them sit on chairs in
front of the table.
Give the message writers a pen and full plain paper.
On the opposite end of the playground, dig two holes apart deep enough for the ns to sink in.
Put the ns in the holes and cover the each hole with a stone.
Ask the team to choose two of the fast thinkers among them to go sit next to the holes. For
each team give 1 pen and full plain paper to the two selected children.
Let the remaining team members line up spaced between their message writers and their
message ‘unscramblers’.
When the game begins, the two children at the hole to roll the stone away and pick the folded
papers one at a me from the ns. The two work together to unscramble the word in that piece
of paper and writes it down. Then one of the pass the word to the teammate standing next to
them, the teammate pass message to the person in front and so on unl the message reaches
the person next to the message writer. The message writer writes the word. The process
connues unl all papers in the n are over.
Once the game is over, compare the wrien words from the uncrambers and the message
writers I they are the same of some messages were lost along the way.
The confirm the unscrambled words with the original words if they match.
